## Introduction

---
Research showing that cognitive training protocols can improve visual attention, inhibition or conflict-related attention, working memory and reasoning occasionally show improvements limited to the trained tasks but rarely to broader abilities. `Ackerman, Kanfer, & Calderwood, 2010`

The finite set of training programs often employed in training studies limits continued progress or efficacy; computer programs or games employed are often built from scratch by the researchers, a process that can be time-consuming and resource-expensive.

## Methods

### Participants

219 participants (ages 18–30) were recruited from the Champaign–Urbana community and were paid $10/h for all sessions. To encourage completion of the study, participants were informed that if they discontinued participation before the last session, payment would be $5/h instead. Three subjects were disqualified after the first testing session due to participation in a game training study (Space Fortress) that used a subset of similar assessment tasks. Seven subjects dropped out at different points of the study and their data was included in the separate analyses of tasks and games. However, data from these seven subjects was not included in the combined task and game analyses, resulting in a final combined sample of 209 participants (33% male; mean age=21.68, SD=2.9; mean years of education=14.91, SD=1.92). Game data for one or two sessions was not collected for 33 individuals due to technical recording errors or experimental error. Listwise and pairwise exclusion analyses were performed accordingly to account for the missing data. Descriptive statistics of all measures can be found in Appendix A.
