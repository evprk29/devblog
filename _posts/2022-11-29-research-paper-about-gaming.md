Research showing that cognitive training protocols can improve visual attention, inhibition or conflict-related attention, working memory and reasoning occasionally show improvements limited to the trained tasks but rarely to broader abilities.

The finite set of training programs often employed in training studies limits continued progress or efficacy; computer programs or games employed are often built from scratch by the researchers, a process that can be time-consuming and resource-expensive.
