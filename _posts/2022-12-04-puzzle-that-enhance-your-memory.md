Figure 1: Sudoku starting point

Figure 1 shows how Sudoku looks like at the start. Usually, it is played on 9x9 tiles, and within the tiles, it is divided into 9 tiles again. Some of the spaces have numbers written in them while the other spaces are blank. Each row, column and square, which are 9 spaces each, needs to be filled out with the numbers from 1 to 9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square. If the game gets too easy, the player can pick different levels at any time, which will then give a game with more spaces like 12x12 grids.

With many years, newspapers have regularly featured this number game for a good reason.Players rely heavily on working memory during the game, as they have to keep a series of numbers in their head while mentally rehearsing where to locate them in 9x9 grids. But keep in mind that Sudoku is said to work best in the beginning, before your brain becomes used to organizing the numbers. Therefore, if the game gets too easy, it is recommended for the players to move up to higher level.
