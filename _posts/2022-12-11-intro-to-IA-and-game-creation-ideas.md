> This page includes lessons on IA (Information Architecture) and some ideas on the game we are planning to make.

### Intro to IA

---
IA, also known as Information Architecture, is the practice of labeling and giving structure to digital content.

Figure 1 is an example of an IA for youtube musice. The structure of the app and the system are represented in the figure through arrows and lines. It shows the options users have when they are in specific place.

### Intro to UI

---

UI, User interface design or user interface engineering, is the design of user interfaces, such as how the app screen apears to the users, and how users can use the app.

### Intro to Wireframe

A wireframe is a two-dimensional representation of a page's interface that focuses on the allocation of content space and priority, available features, and desired behaviors.

### Ideas on game creation

---
We started designing a new game that enhance your memory.

**Figure 5: My design for a new game**

How this game works:

1. When the game starts, you will have few seconds to memorize the shopping list.
2. When the countdown is done, you are given few munutes to remember the sjopping list and put it in the cart.
3. Everytime you success and move onto the next level, the time decrease and the list increase.

### Game we decided on

---

**Figure 6: Final game idea**
How this game works:

1. When the game starts, it will randomly show a pathway with blocks
2. When the blocks reset, you have to remember the pathway and find the exit by clicking on the pathway blocks.
3. If you success, number of blocks will increase and obstacles will appear.

**Figure 8: Developing ideas**

We have developed some ideas on:

- Colors (display) - simple square or circle tiles, rocks, or Hansel and Gretel theme.
- Sounds - bread eating sound or footstep
- Record measure - time taken or the level
- Levels - more tiles or longer length
- Icon
- Name of the puzzle

We came up with some ideas on themes, sounds, icons, display, and colors, and are planning to further develope ideas on these factors.
