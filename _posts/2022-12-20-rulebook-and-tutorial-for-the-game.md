### Final idea on the game UI design

**Figure 1: UI design of the game**

Figure 1 is the final idea on the game UI design, which will have a theme of 'Hansel and Gretel'.The starting tiles will be simple gray colors, and when the game starts, bread will appear one by one on the tiles to indicate the path. When the player clicks on a right tile after the bread is gone, it will turn into white rocks, but if the player clikcs on the wrong tile, red border will appear with a gingerbread house. It will also let the player know which tile was the correct answer by bordering it with green before the game resets.

### Final rulebook

 Rulebook is usually made for app developers to follow, and contains every rules and settings for the game that are essential for the developers when making an app or a game. The rulebook for this game also has every set of rules explained in it with diagrams and pictures to help. It includes abstract, how to play, what happens if it's right, and what happens if it's wrong. Most importantly, it has all the details on how the game is going to proceed along with little details such as sounds, icons, and levels.

### Final tutorial

**Figure 3: Tutorial for the game**

Similar to a rulebook, tutorial explains the rules of the game and how to play it. However, unlike a rulebook, tutorial is for players to follow, so it's more  brief and simple. The tutorial that I made contains all the necessary information that new players need to know to play this game such as how the game is going to start, what they have to do, what are the rules and consequences of each actions, what their goal is in the game, and how it is beneficial. It is written in more simple wordings and has more diagrams instead of word explanation, so that the players can get the idea of the game in less confusing way.
